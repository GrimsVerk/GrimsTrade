# Next steps

## M0 status: built, not yet proven live

Done: template scaffold, data ingest (BTC, ETH, SPY, QQQ, GLD, TLT, append-only CSV), gym
(next-open fills, fees, slippage, long-only, 10,000 USD), 4 benchmark strategies, append-only
ledger + tries counter + git-history integrity check, daily runner + `.github/workflows/daily.yml`,
scoreboard (`python -m grimstrade.report --root trail [--backtest]`), owner README, MIT license.

## To finish M0 (needs someone with GitHub access)

- [ ] Merge this branch to `main` (via PR), then run "Daily paper trading" once by hand
      (workflow_dispatch). Unverified live: Kraken/Coinbase/Yahoo/Stooq formats are from docs,
      tested only on fixtures (dev container can't reach them). Yahoo may 429 from Actions; Stooq is
      the fallback. Check the first run creates the `paper-trail` branch and pushes to it.
- [ ] Check the Actions settings allow GITHUB_TOKEN write (contents: write is requested).
- [ ] If the `protect-main` ruleset is ever widened to all branches, exempt `paper-trail`
      (the bot pushes there directly).

## Assumptions (see docs/DECISIONS.md)

- CSV + stdlib only (no parquet/pandas). Raw prices; dividends not credited yet.
- Bot commits to orphan branch `paper-trail` because `main` requires PRs.
- Costs: crypto 25 bps fee + 5 bps slip; ETFs 0 fee + 2 bps slip; 1% rebalance band.
- Decisions at ~22:30 UTC see crypto bars through yesterday (today's still open) and ETFs through
  today. Fills show up a day later, once the fill bar has closed and been stored.
- A run with no new data since a strategy's last decision writes no new decision.
- Gymnasium env wrapper deferred (BACKLOG).

## M1: done (merged 2026-11-12, PR #3)

Brief: chief-of-staff/briefs/grimstrade-m1.md. The details are in PR #3 and docs/DECISIONS.md.

- Live in paper (they start at the next daily run, 22:30 UTC): `ts_momentum`, `xs_momentum`,
  `vol_target_spy`, `risk_parity`, `crypto_mean_reversion`, next to the four M0 yardsticks.
  Funding-rate carry is in BACKLOG.
- Scoreboard has a deflated Sharpe column (after 30 days). N counts the research lane's tries,
  each recorded by identity in `ledger/research_tries.jsonl` on paper-trail.
- `reports/weekly.md` (owner, plain language) and `reports/backtest.md` (hindsight, kept apart)
  are written every run.
- Reviews by Fable: DSR maths, each strategy against its paper, and the final PR review; all
  findings fixed and re-verified.
- Worth watching after the first M1 run (2026-11-12 22:30 UTC): the daily job is green, 9
  strategies in `ledger/tries.jsonl`, and `weekly.md` reads well.
- Merging `audit-1` may conflict in `ledger.py`/`gym.py` (M1 added the research-try functions,
  the `APPEND_ONLY` tuple and a finite-weights check in `validate`).

PR #3 merged (rebase) 2026-11-12 01:48 UTC; CI on main green; 114 tests pass. Owner: merge the
small docs PR that brings this section to main (branch `m1-wrapup`).
